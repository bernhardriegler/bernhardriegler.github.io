# Click to Destroy

This project is a fun interactive webpage where elements can be clicked to make them fall, bounce, and interact with physics. Additionally, clicking the "Boom" button triggers an explosion effect, making the `<h1>` text crumble into individual characters and bounce around. A playful "April Fools!" animation appears shortly after.
