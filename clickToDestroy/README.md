# Click to Destroy

This project is a fun interactive webpage where elements can be clicked to make them fall, bounce, and interact with physics. Additionally, clicking the "Boom" button triggers an explosion effect, making the `<h1>` text crumble into individual characters and bounce around. A playful "April Fools!" animation appears shortly after.

## Features

- **Interactive Physics**: Clickable elements (links, buttons) fall and bounce with realistic physics.
- **Explosion Effect**: Clicking the "Boom" button makes the `<h1>` text explode into individual characters.
- **April Fools Animation**: A playful "April Fools!" message appears and grows in size after the explosion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the webpage structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling the elements and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and animations.
- **Matter.js**: A 2D physics engine for realistic physics simulations.
- **html2canvas**: To capture DOM elements as textures for physics bodies.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage in a browser.
2. Click on any link or button to make it fall and bounce.
3. Click the "Boom" button to trigger the explosion effect and the "April Fools!" animation.
